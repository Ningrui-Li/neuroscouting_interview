    This function will generate a tree following the guidelines given in the assignment. The
    root node will always be 1. The left child node will contain the sum of the parent node's value and
    the value of the node to the left of the parent. If the parent is the leftmost node, then the left child
    node will just hold the same value held by its parent. The right child node will contain the sum of the
    parent node's value and the value of the node to the right of the parent. If the parent is the rightmost node, then the left child node will just hold the same value held by its parent.
